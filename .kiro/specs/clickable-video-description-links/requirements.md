# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the video description display functionality by automatically converting URLs found in YouTube video descriptions into clickable links. Currently, video descriptions are displayed as plain text, making it difficult for users to access referenced links, social media profiles, or related content mentioned in the video descriptions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor viewing a video page, I want URLs in video descriptions to be clickable links, so that I can easily navigate to referenced content without having to copy and paste URLs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video description contains a URL starting with http:// or https:// THEN the system SHALL convert it to a clickable link
2. WHEN a video description contains a URL without protocol (e.g., www.example.com) THEN the system SHALL convert it to a clickable link with https:// protocol
3. WHEN a user clicks on a converted link THEN the system SHALL open the link in a new tab/window
4. WHEN a converted link is displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain the original text styling while making it visually distinct as a clickable link

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the video description formatting to be preserved while having clickable links, so that the description remains readable and well-formatted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system converts URLs to links THEN it SHALL preserve all existing whitespace and line breaks in the description
2. WHEN multiple URLs exist in a description THEN the system SHALL convert all valid URLs to clickable links
3. WHEN URLs are converted to links THEN the system SHALL maintain the surrounding text formatting and spacing
4. WHEN the description contains no URLs THEN the system SHALL display the text exactly as before without any changes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want clickable links to be secure and safe, so that I'm protected from potential security risks when clicking external links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a link is created THEN the system SHALL add rel="noopener noreferrer" attributes for security
2. WHEN a link is created THEN the system SHALL add target="_blank" to open in new tab
3. WHEN processing URLs THEN the system SHALL only convert valid URL patterns to prevent false positives
4. WHEN displaying converted links THEN the system SHALL use appropriate styling to indicate they are external links

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the link conversion functionality to be reusable and maintainable, so that it can be easily tested and potentially used in other parts of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the URL conversion THEN the system SHALL create a separate utility function for link processing
2. WHEN the utility function is created THEN it SHALL handle edge cases like URLs at the beginning/end of text
3. WHEN the utility function processes text THEN it SHALL return properly formatted JSX elements
4. WHEN the utility function is implemented THEN it SHALL be easily testable with unit tests
